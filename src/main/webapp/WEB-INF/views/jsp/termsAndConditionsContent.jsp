				</p>


				<p class="tc-style06 tc-style03">18.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the duration of the Subscription Period, the other parameter for a Subscription is the Active User Limit allowance, which may be increased (but may not be decreased) during an Active Subscription, as shown in Scenario II in the table
					above. The Customer&apos;s Administrator can increase the Active User Limit for a current Subscription Block or future Subscription Block, which will be effective from the current date to the Subscription Expiry Date of the current Subscription Block (or future Subscription Block, as the case
					may be). Once a Subscription Block or a future Subscription Block is created on the platform, the duration of that Subscription Block may not be changed and only the Active User Limit can be increased in accordance with this section 18.</p>



				<p class="tc-style03 tc-style12 tc-style06">
					19.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Customer desires to reduce its Active User Limit, the Customer must enter into a new User-Based Subscription Block whereby the reduced Active User Limit will apply upon the commencement of the new Subscription Block. If the new Subscription Block has a lower number of
					Active Users than the Active Users in the current Subscription Block, the Customer&apos;s Administrator will receive three (3) notifications, i.e., within one (1) month, two (2) weeks and one (1) week before the Subscription Expiry Date of the then-current Subscription Block to the effect that
					all Active Users except the Customer&apos;s Administrator will be deactivated from the platform unless the Customer reduces the current number of Active Users or increases the Active User limit for the future Subscription Block. If the Customer&apos;s Administrator fails to do so, all Active
					Users will receive an e-mail and a system notification two (2) days before the start date of the next Subscription Block stating that: &quot;<I>Your account will be deactivated in forty-eight (48) hours. Please contact your administrator for any inquiries</I>&quot;, and their account will
					deactivated at the end of the current block or start of the next block.
				</p>


				<p class="tc-style03 tc-style12 tc-style06">20.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Active User Limit will take effect immediately upon the payment for the increase in Active User Limit count during an Active User-Based Subscription Period. However, regardless when the Active User Limit was increased prior
					to the Subscription Expiry Date for that Subscription, the increase in Active Users will only be valid until the then-current Subscription Expiry Date for that Subscription Block.</p>



				<p class="tc-style03 tc-style12 tc-style06">21.&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotions, discounts, loyalty benefits or incentives, if any, offered to the Customer may be redeemed through the provision of a promotional code which may be entered prior to subscribing for a Subscription.</p>



				<p class="tc-style03 tc-style12 tc-style06">22.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customer accepts that no refunds howsoever arising will be given for any Purchased User-Based Subscriptions, including for any Purchased extensions to the Subscription Period or any Purchased increase in the Active User Limit
					count.</p>

				<p class="tc-style06 tc-style06 tc-style03">
					<B>AUTO RENEWAL</B>
				</p>

				<p class="tc-style03 tc-style12 tc-style06">
					23.&nbsp;&nbsp;Auto renewals of any Subscription Period are subject to the availability of the Customer&apos;s <I>Paypal</I> account.
				</p>



				<p class="tc-style03 tc-style12 tc-style06">24.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customer can choose to have the Subscription Period auto-renewed upon the Subscription Expiry Date. This option must be set at the time of the creation of a Subscription Block. The auto-renewal option does not allow for the
					creation of manually subscribed future Subscription Blocks.</p>



				<p class="tc-style03 tc-style12 tc-style06">
					25.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the auto-renewal option is selected, the system will automatically create a new Subscription Block of the same duration, user limit and pricing, seven (7) days before the expiry of the then-current Subscription Block and the Customer&apos;s <I>PayPal </I>account will be
					debited for that auto renewal Subscription Block. If the payment fails, due to any reason whatsoever, the system will notify the Customer and a further attempt to debit Customer&apos;s account again after twenty-four (24) hours will be made. If the payment fails a second time, the new
					Subscription Block will not be created and the auto-renewal will be cancelled.
				</p>



				<p class="tc-style03 tc-style12 tc-style06">26.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Customer increases the Active User Limit for the then-current Subscription Block, the Customer&apos;s auto-renewal setting will cease and deactivate. The Customer may only re-set the auto-renewal setting when the Customer
					creates the next Subscription Block, and the first auto-payment will start at the Subscription Expiry Date of that (subsequent) Subscription Block.</p>



				<p class="tc-style03 tc-style12 tc-style06">
					27.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, at any point during a Subscription Block, the Customer received a certain set of rates or otherwise enjoys a Promotional Code (for example, a twenty percent (20%) discount) (&quot; <B>Current Rates</B>&quot;), and if <I>PROCUREHRE</I> subsequently changes the pricing (for
					example to state that Customers are entitled to receive a ten percent (10%) discount instead) (&quot;<B>New Rates</B>&quot;), the auto-renewal setting will continue to bill the Customer at the Current Rates. If the Customer cancels its auto-renewal setting for whatever reason and enters into a
					new or future Subscription Block, the New Rates shall apply (as determined by <I>PROCUREHRE</I> ).
				<p class="tc-style06 tc-style06 tc-style03">
					<B>TEMPORARY EXTRA USERS</B>
				</p>


				<p class="tc-style03 tc-style12 tc-style06">28.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the User-Based Subscription system described hereinabove, the Customer may subscribe to and pay for in advance temporary extra Users for projects at the rate of USD 199 per User for each specific calendar month. At the
					end of such specified calendar month, the Active User Limit will revert to the original limit.</p>

				<p class="tc-style06 tc-style06 tc-style03">
					<B>SWITCHING FROM EVENT-BASED SUBSCRIPTION TO USER-BASED SUBSCRIPTION</B>
				</p>

				<p class="tc-style03 tc-style12 tc-style06">29.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any switch from a Purchased Event-based Subscription to a User-based Subscription during an Active Event-based Subscription will result in all Event Credits being forfeited without refund, and the new (User-Based) Subscription will
					take effect immediately. The Active User Limit and Event Limit will be updated accordingly, corresponding to the nature of the User Based Subscription Active Users in section 10 above for which the Customer has Purchased.</p>
